# PacMan-Project
Here you can find my personal version of PacMan in Phyton. 

The intention is to improve the game until it gets similar to the original.

The game was developed on Phyton and the main script is PacManOfficial.py
I exploited the g2d graphics library and implemented the game with the original sprites that you can find in the png files.
